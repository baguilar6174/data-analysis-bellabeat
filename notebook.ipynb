Does your data ROCCC?\n","\n","- **Unreliable**: The potential for sampling bias exists due to the limited sample size.\n","- **Incomplete**: The study lacks comprehensive demographic information on its anonymous participants, particularly regarding the usage patterns of the target demographic (women) with this product. Demographic information, such as gender, age, and health status, is unavailable. Given that Bellabeat’s target audience is women, having data focused specifically on this demographic would be optimal. However, it’s important to note that the absence of this demographic data may introduce a potential sampling bias\n","- **Outdated**: The dataset is time-constrained and not undergoing current updates.

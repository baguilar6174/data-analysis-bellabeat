Thirty eligible Fitbit users consented to the submission of personal tracker data, including minute-level output for physical activity, heart rate, and sleep monitoring. Individual reports can be parsed by export session ID (column A) or timestamp (column B). Variation between output represents use of different types of Fitbit trackers and individual tracking behaviors / preferences.\n","\n","\n","## How is the data organized? Is it in long or wide format?\n","\n","The provided Kaggle dataset comprises personal fitness tracker data from thirty-three Fitbit users. These users have consented to submit their personal tracker data, which includes minute-level records of physical activity, heart rate, and sleep monitoring. The dataset encompasses details about daily activity, steps taken, and heart rate measurements, facilitating an exploration of users' habits. The dataset consists of 29 CSV files, each describing the aforementioned information at various levels of granularity. These data were collected from March 12, 2016, to May 12, 2016, spanning a period of two months.\n","\n","| File Name | Description |\n","|--------|----------|\n","| **dailyActivity_merged** | Daily tracking over 31 days for 33 users of steps, distance travelled, tracker distance, logged activities distance, intensity of activity in terms of distance and minutes, and calories burned   |\n","| **dailyCalories_merged** | Daily calories burned over 31 days for 33 users |\n","| **dailyIntensities_merged** | Daily intensity tracked over 31 days for 33 users.

Does your data ROCCC?\n","\n","- **Unreliable**: The potential for sampling bias exists due to the limited sample size.\n","- **Incomplete**: The study lacks comprehensive demographic information on its anonymous participants, particularly regarding the usage patterns of the target demographic (women) with this product. Demographic information, such as gender, age, and health status, is unavailable. Given that Bellabeat’s target audience is women, having data focused specifically on this demographic would be optimal. However, it’s important to note that the absence of this demographic data may introduce a potential sampling bias\n","- **Outdated**: The dataset is time-constrained and not undergoing current updates.
